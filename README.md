# Electiona Analysis Using Python

## Overview of the analysis

This election analysis was carried for the Colorado Board of Election to audit the tabulated results of a congressional precinct. 
#### The following analysis were performed:

1. Calculating the total number of votes cast
2. Compiling a list of candidates who received votes
3. Calculating the total number of votes for each county
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate received
5. Determining the winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Resources
1.Software:

   •Python 3.7 

   • Visual Studio code

2.Data source: 

    election_results-csv

### After completing the initial analysis further analysis was done to include the following:

•	The voter turnout for each county

•	The percentage of votes for each county 

•	The county with the highest turnout

## The election-audit results were as follows:

### The list of candidates in the race

•	Charles Casper Stockham

•	Diana DeGette

•	Raymon Anthony Doane

### The Election Results

### Total number of votes cast: 369,711

#### Voter turnout by county:
•	Jefferson: 38,855

•	Denver: 306,055

•	Arapahoe: 24,801

#### Voter percentage by county:

•	Jefferson:  10.5% 

•	Denver:  82.8% 

•	Arapahoe:  6.7% 

#### Candidate total votes and percentage: 

•	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote with a total of 85,213 votes.

#### The election winner

•	The overall winner for the election was Diana DeGette who received 73.8% of the vote with a total of 272,892 votes.

## Summary

The python script that was used for this election analysis was very effective in giving a clear and accurate picture of the voting outcomes for one specific congressional precinct. 

#### The script was able to calculate the following:

1.	Total votes cast
2.	The winner of the election
3.	Total votes cast by each county
4.	Largest county voter turnout
5.	The total votes cast for each candidate as well as the percentage of the votes they received

### Modifying the python script for other elections

The same Python script can be modified for the following purposes:

1.	To analyze the results of any election by simply changing the data and applying the same python statements appropriate for that data
2.	Using similar if statements from the original script to calculate different outcomes of an election such as:

      •	Total votes and percentage of votes received by each candidate in every county
  
      •	Total votes and percentage of votes received from different demographics
  
      •	Total votes and percentage of votes received from different age groups

This election analysis was carried for Colorado Board of Election to audit the tabulated results of a congressional precinct. 
#The following analysis were performed 
1. Calculating the total number of votes
2. Getting a complete list of candidates who received votes
3.Calculating the total number of votes each candidate won 
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate won
5. Determining the winner of the election based on the popular vote

## Resources
1.Software: Python 3.7 and Visual Studio code
2. Data source: election_results-csv

### After completing the initial analysis further analysis was done to include the following:

•	The voter turnout for each county
•	The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
•	The county with the highest turnout

#The election-audit results were as follows:

Election-Audit Summary: 
Modifying the python script
The python script that was used for this election analysis was very effective in giving a clear and accurate picture of the voting outcomes for one specific congressional precinct. The script was able to calculate the following:
1.	Total votes cast
2.	The winner of the election
3.	Total votes cast by each county
4.	Largest county voter turnout
5.	The total votes cast for each candidates as well as the percentage of the votes they received
Modifying the script
The same Python script can be modified for the following purposes
1.	To analyze the results of any election by simply changing the data and applying the same python statements appropriate for that data
2.	Using similar if statements from the original script to calculate different outcomes of an election such as
	Total votes and percentage of votes received by each candidate in every county
	Total votes and percentage of votes received from different demographics
	Total votes and percentage of votes received from different age groups
